                <p>This tool offers a playful way to spark creativity and innovation. By combining a random product with a unique constraint, it challenges you to think outside the box and envision new design possibilities.</p>
                <p>Click the "Regenerate idea" button to display a new product idea with an associated constraint. Use these prompts to kick-start your AI-related brainstorming session.</p>

                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>The generator was built by an UX-designer, without any front-end experience, only using ChatGPT-4. It was first of all an experiment to explore ChatGPT's capabilities and how a designer can aproach development with only natural language.</p> 
                <p>ChatGPT generated all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code, managed all debugging, generated the background image, the 100 products and 50 constraints, as well as majority of the copy.</p>
